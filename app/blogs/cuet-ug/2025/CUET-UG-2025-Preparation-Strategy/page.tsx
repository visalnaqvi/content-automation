Our goal is to provide you with a solid roadmap to guide your preparations in a systematic manner.</p>

        <h2 className="sub-headings">Understanding the CUET UG Exam Structure</h2>
        <p>The first step in your <strong>CUET UG</strong> preparation is to understand the exam structure comprehensively. The <strong>CUET UG</strong> typically consists of various sections, including language tests, domain-specific subjects, and general studies. Knowing the weightage of each subject will help you prioritize your study time effectively. Focus on subjects that carry more marks and ensure you allocate adequate time to each according to the syllabus.</p>

        <h2 className="sub-headings">Creating a Timetable for Effective Study</h2>
        <p>Creating a personalized study timetable is essential for systematic study and effective time management during your <strong>CUET UG</strong> preparation. Divide your preparation into weekly sprints, ensuring you cover each subject comprehensively. For instance, allocate specific days for each subject, allowing for revision and buffer time before the examination. Make sure to stick to the timetable as rigorously as possible while allowing for flexibility when needed. A well-organized study schedule will help you maximize your learning and retention.</p>

        <h2 className="sub-headings">Subject-Wise Study Plan</h2>
        <p>Your study plan needs to be customized for each subject based on personal strengths, weaknesses, and the syllabus. Below, we break down a sample study plan as per subjects:</p>

Frequent self-assessment through mock tests not only provides a sense of progress but also builds test-taking confidence.</p>
